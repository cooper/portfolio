    This is a demo of a custom [b]S[/b]tudent [b]I[/b]nformation [b]S[/b]ystem
    solution that integrates total account sychronization across the many cloud and
    e-curricula services in demand of the modern school district.

    The suite supplements an existing primary SIS to
    maintain a secure database of autogenerated student passwords;
    synchronize accounts across Active Directory, G Suite, and online curricula
    engines; and safely convey sensitive student credentials to teachers.

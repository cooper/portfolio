    quiki is a file-based web content engine and standalone server featuring its own
    productive markup source language, markdown support, image generation, categories,
    templating, and git revision tracking.

    Best of all, there are no databases and no dependencies. It can be installed with
    [[ one command | https://quiki.app/get-started ]], and pages can be easily created
    with either a plain text editor or the built-in web panel.

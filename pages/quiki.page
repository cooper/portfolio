    quiki is a standalone web server for wikifier.
    
    wikifier is a wiki engine, and it alone is not capable of serving
    content directly to users. Instead, web servers must communicate with
    wikifier via some sort of transport, usually utilizing PHP or some other
    intermediate language to do so.
    
    quiki makes it easier to get a wikifier-based site up and running in just
    minutes. It runs as a standalone server with built-in logic for
    communicating with wikifier, eliminating the need for a messy intermediary.
    It can be proxied to incorporate into any existing web environment.
    
    quiki powers this website and several others.

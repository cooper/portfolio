    quiki is a standalone web server for wikifier.
    
    wikifier is a wiki engine, and it alone is not capable of serving
    content directly to users. Instead, web servers must communicate with
    wikifier via some sort of transport, usually utilizing PHP or some other
    intermediate language to do so.
    
    quiki makes it easier to get a site up and running in just minutes,
    eliminating the need for an intermediary. It can be incorporated into any
    existing web environment with a proxy.
    
    quiki powers this website and several others.

    adminifier is an administrative web panel for wikifier.
    
    The whole point of wikifier is that it is file-based, meaning you can
    edit the content easily from a simple text editor. This was fine at first
    but became tedious once I expanded wikifier to be a full-blown CMS.
    
    Written in PHP, this administrative frontend is an independent project
    which makes it easy to manage a wikifier-based website from the web browser.
    It features a page editor with a large array of visual tools,
    media uploader, revision viewer, site configuration editor, and more.
    
    adminifier does not provide a WYSIWYG editor but instead embraces the
    minimalistic elegance of the wikifier markup language with a variety of
    tools to simplify its writing.

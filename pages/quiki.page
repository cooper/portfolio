    quiki is a file-based web content engine and standalone server featuring its own
    super-legible and productive markup language, Markdown support,
    image sizing, categories, templating, caching, and git revision tracking.

    Best of all, there are no databases and no dependencies. It can be effortlessly
    installed with a single command, and pages are
    easily created with either a plain text editor or the built-in web panel.

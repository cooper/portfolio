    [b]L[/b]unch [b]M[/b]enu [b]M[/b]anger is a centralized solution for
    maintaining and distributing cafeteria menus. It is written in PHP and
    stores data in an SQLite database, making it quite portable and fairly
    simple to incorporate into any facility's existing web services.

    LMM turns a tedious, repetitive multi-step process into one which can be
    completed weeks or months in advance in just one sitting. Input your menu
    just [i]once[/i], and let LMM handle the logistics.
    
    I created this as a school improvement project while I was a technology
    intern at my high school but then decided to open source it. LMM is in
    production at multiple schools now.

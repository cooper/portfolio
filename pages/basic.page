    Quality is my [i]basic[/i] policy.

    This template demonstrates a modern image-rich small business website.
    
    For many small businesses such as this autobody shop, imagery is more
    powerful than words in demonstrating the quality of work. This example
    emphasizes past works but also features a work request/estimate inquiry
    form as well as a general contact form.

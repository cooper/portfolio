    screenmgr is a tool for monitoring and managing a collection of computer
    screens. It communicates with devices on a local network via a number of
    protocols for monitoring uptime/reachability, viewing the screen, and
    remote control via a web interface.
        
    My diverse collection of old computers was the motivation for this project.
    It originally was written in node.js and Perl, only supporting Mac OS 8/9/X
    for my Power Mac collection; but I later rewrote it in Go and added support
    for Windows and UNIX-like operating systems.

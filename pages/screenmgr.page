    screenmgr is a tool for monitoring and managing a collection of computer
    screens. It communicates with devices on a local network via a number of
    protocols for monitoring uptime/reachability, viewing the screen, and
    remote control.
    
    Supported protocols include ICMP ping (monitor reachability),
    WOL (boot via network), SSH (remote commands, shutdown, restart), and
    VNC (screen streaming). Devices are monitored and controlled via a web
    user interface.
    
    My diverse collection of old computers was the motivation for this project.
    It originally was written in node.js and Perl, only supporting Mac OS 8/9/X
    for my Power Mac collection. But I later rewrote it in Go and added support
    for Windows and more UNIX-like operating systems.

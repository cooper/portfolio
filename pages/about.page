        Here's a little about my background and where I'm at today.
    }

    
    Technology has been my primary interest for as long as I can remember. It
    started at a young age with the disassembly, examination, and attempted
    reconstruction of clock radios, telephone answering machines, and whichever
    other gadgets were within my short reach; but I later graduated to
    hand-me-down computers and discovered them to be far more intriguing.

    After years of careful trial-and-error, I became self-taught
    in hands-on computer work as well as a number of programming languages. I
    was privileged to offer my skills to friends and family in my Indiana
    hometown of 500 through computer repair and support services, a hobby which
    quickly broadened beyond them by word of mouth.
    As just a kid, I realized I would have to prove my ability by working in
    advance and presenting finished products without ever having been asked to
    produce anything. Before long, this landed me web design gigs for local
    businesses and civic organizations.

    In high school, the same aforementioned friends and family continued to
    offer their support as I ventured across the country to compete in mobile
    app development competitions in which I ended up placing first in Indiana
    then second nationally two years in a row and enjoyed stardom in local news.

        Since then, while working directly with students and faculty at K12 schools,
        I discovered a newfound love for the power of technology in education and
        the joy it brings to young (and old) faces.

    For two years, I had the privilege of working at
    [[ Frontier School Corporation | https://frontierschoolsin.org ]]
    as a software developer, network administrator, and technology
    support technician. It is a small school district with an even tinier
    technology team that does most everything in-house and without the help of
    contractors, which allowed me to dip my feet in all sorts of valuable
    experience; and for that, I am extremely grateful.

    In July 2018, amidst the Mojave Desert's scorching summer heat, I
    relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada and acceped a job as a computer technician
    at the [[ Clark County School District | https://ccsd.net ]], one of the
    largest in the nation. As you might imagine, it was quite an adjustment to
    transition from a district of two schools and 650 students to one of more
    than 350 schools and 320,000 students, but I have embraced the change.

    In addition to my day jobs and [[ hobbies | ~hobby ]] (and also to satisfy
    my love of coding), I keep myself extra busy
    with contracted side work. I am currently providing off-site software development for K12
    schools[---]namely, my recent projects include custom student and faculty
    information systems solutions that integrate total account sychronization
    across the many cloud and e-curricula services in demand of the modern
    school district.

    I hope to [[ hear | contact ]] from you!

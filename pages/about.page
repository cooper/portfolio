        Here's a little about my background and where I'm at today.
    }

    
    Technology has been my primary interest for as long as I can remember. It
    started at a young age with the disassembly, examination, and attempted
    reconstruction of clock radios, telephone answering machines, and whichever
    other gadgets were within my short reach; but I later graduated to
    hand-me-down computers and discovered them to be far more intriguing.

    After years of careful trial-and-error, I became self-taught
    in hands-on computer work as well as a number of programming languages. I
    was privileged to offer my skills to friends and family in my Indiana
    hometown of 500 through computer repair and support services, a hobby which
    quickly broadened beyond them by word of mouth.
    As just a kid, I realized I would have to prove my ability by working in
    advance and presenting finished products without ever having been asked to
    produce anything. Before long, this landed me web design gigs for local
    businesses.

    Meanwhile, those same aforementioned friends and family continued to
    offer their support as I ventured across the country to compete in
    [[ mobile app development | ~ios ]]
    competitions in which I ended up placing first in Indiana
    then second nationally two years in a row and enjoyed stardom in local news.

    Since then, I have worked primarily in K-12 school systems as a software
    developer, network administrator, and technology support technician.
    In Indiana, I had the privilege of working at
    [[ Frontier School Corporation | https://frontierschoolsin.org ]],
    a small school district with an even tinier
    technology team that does most everything in-house and without the help of
    specialists or contractors, which allowed me to dip my feet in all sorts of valuable
    experience and learn-by-doing; and for that, I am extremely grateful.
    Then in July 2018, amidst the Mojave Desert's scorching summer heat, I
    relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada and accepted a job at the
    [[ Clark County School District | https://ccsd.net ]], one of the
    largest in the nation. It was quite an adjustment to
    transition from a district of two schools and 650 students to one of more
    than 350 schools and 320,000 students, but I embraced the change.

    I love
    the power of technology in action and the joy it brings to young (and old) faces. 
    In addition to working directly with students and faculty, my coding projects in this
    area include [[ cafeteria management software | lmm ]], custom software deployment suites,
    and most notably, [[ student information systems solutions | sis ]] that integrate total
    account synchronization across the many cloud and e-curricula services in demand of
    the modern school district.

    Now I am ready for another new chapter as I move back east again this summer.
    I have also kept myself extra busy with contracted side work and various
    open source projects. I invite you to explore them on this site and hope to
    [[ hear | contact ]] from you!

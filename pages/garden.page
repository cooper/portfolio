    You thought this was only about coding! No, this page is called "hobbies"
    after all...
    
    I love working outside in my garden. I've spent more time and shed more
    sweat in there than anywhere else. In practice, I am not the world's most
    successful gardener. Yet, I am always planning my garden each year long
    before the last frost. It's worth noting that I am not a health nut;
    i.e., I do not garden because I am afraid of preservatives or GMOs.
    Gardening certainly does not save me a significant amount of money either.
    
    I do it because I find it enjoyable, and the food tastes better when grown
    at home. It also has social value as a means by which to impress my
    neighbors and whoever else strolls by.

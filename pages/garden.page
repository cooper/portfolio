    Back in Indiana, I loved working outside in my garden. I've shed more
    sweat there than anywhere else. In practice, I was never the world's best gardener;
    yet, I was always in planning mode long before the last frost. I didn't do it to be
    healthy or due to fear of GMOs... and [i]certainly[/i] not to save money (ha)!
    I just found it enjoyable, and food tastes better when grown at home. I liked how
    it politely boasted my hard work for anyone who strolled by, too.

    Growing up, my dad always had an immaculate vegetable garden, and my mom surrounded our house
    with carefully nurtured flower beds. I miss it, but the weather is too harsh here
    in the Mojave. Luckily, my love of plants is still 
    fulfilled by my now extensive collection of cacti and succulents!

            desc:   I bought these brackets at Lowes to hang it over our porch ledge, but the
                    box is way too big for them, and so is our ledge. They were the only flower box
                    brackets they had, so we had to compromise. It's supposed to cradle the box and
                    hang over a fence like 2-3" thick, but instead we have it upside down, with the
                    part that's supposed to be under the box over the ledge and the other part drilled
                    into the bottom and back of the box. It was Brittany's idea. Had to get the power
                    tools out for just this one part.;

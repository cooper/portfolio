    We can predict it, but we can't control it. Until now.

    If you're like me, you almost never check your weather app. On the
    rare occurrence that I do, I'm probably already stranded on the side of
    the road, wondering why I allow myself to be so ill-prepared.

    WeatherApp warns you when a storm's brewing. Hidden beneath its
    minimalistic UI and stunning imagery is more in-depth
    information than your stock weather app, including extensive forecasts and
    historical weather data.
    
    I submitted the code and presented WeatherApp to a group of judges for a
    Mobile Applications competition in Indianapolis, placing first in Indiana
    and section in the nation.

    We can predict it, but we can't control it. Until now.

    If you're like me, you almost never check your phone's weather app. On the
    rare occurrence that I do such a thing, I'm probably already stranded on the
    side of the road wondering why I allow myself to be so ill-prepared.
    
    WeatherApp warns you when it's going to rain. Hidden beneath its
    minimalistic UI and stunning imagery, it offers more detailed
    information than stock weather apps, including extensive forecasts and
    historical weather data.
    
    I submitted the code and presented WeatherApp to a group of judges for a
    Mobile Applications competition in Indianapolis. After being awarded first
    place in the state, I went on to place second at the national level.

        Hi, I'm Mitch.
    }
    
    I'm a Las Vegas Valley web and mobile app developer with a focus in education.
    
    Technology has been my primary interest for as long as I can remember.
    For years I was privileged to offer computer support and repair services,
    a hobby which quickly expanded beyond my friends and family, but since then
    I have discovered a love for the role of technology in education.


    

but more recently my time has been
    allocated primarily to freelance and hobby software development.
    
    I would be thrilled to work with you on your next project, whether it be
    a simple website like this one or a sophisticated million-dollar app idea.
    You'll find on this site an assortment of my current and past works,
    each demonstrating my diverse skillset.

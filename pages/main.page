        I'm an award-winning Las Vegas Valley [[ ~web ]] and
        [[ mobile app | ~ios ]] developer with a focus in [b]education[/b].
        Here's a little about my background and where I'm at today.
    }

    
    Technology has been my primary interest for as long as I can remember. It
    started at a young age with the disassembly, examination, and attempted
    reconstruction of clock radios, telephone answering machines, and whichever
    other gadgets were within my short reach; but I later graduated to
    hand-me-down computers and discovered them to be far more intriguing.

    After years of careful trial-and-error, I became self-taught
    in hands-on computer work as well as a number of programming languages. I
    was privileged to offer my skills to friends and family in my Indiana
    hometown of 500 through computer repair and support services, a hobby which
    quickly broadened beyond them by word of mouth.

    As just a kid, I realized I would have to prove my ability by working in
    advance and presenting finished products without ever having been asked to
    produce anything. Before long, this landed me web design gigs for local
    businesses and civic organizations.

    In high school, the same aforementioned friends and family continued to
    offer their support as I ventured across the country to compete in mobile
    app development competitions in which I ended up placing second nationally
    two years in a row and enjoyed stardom in local news.

    Since then, while working directly with students and faculty as a K12
    district technology assistant, I've discovered a newfound love for the power
    of technology in education and the joy it brings to young (and old) faces.

    I am currently providing off-site software development for K12
    schools[---]namely, my recent projects include custom student and faculty
    information systems solutions that integrate total account sychronization
    across the many cloud and e-curricula services in demand of the modern
    school district. However, I'm looking to also re-enter the wonderful sort
    of educational work environment I grew to love while working at schools in
    person.

    I hope to [[ hear | Contact ]] from you!

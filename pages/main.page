        Hi, I'm Mitch.
    }
    
    I'm an award-winning Las Vegas Valley web and mobile app developer with a
    focus in education.
    
    Technology has been my primary interest for as long as I can remember. It
    started at a young age with the disassembly, examination, and attempted
    reconstruction of clock radios, telephone answering machines, and whichever
    other gadgets were within my short reach; but I later graduated to
    hand-me-down computers and discovered them to be far more intriguing.

    After years of careful trial-and-error, I became self-taught
    in hands-on computer work as well as a number of programming langauges. I
    was privileged to offer my skills to friends and family in Indiana
    through computer repair and support services, a hobby which quickly
    broadened beyond them by word of mouth.

    As just a kid, I realized I would have to prove my ability by working in
    advance and presenting finished products without ever having been asked to
    produce anything. Before long, this landed me web design gigs for local
    businesses and civic organizations.

    In high school, the same aforementioned friends and family continued to
    support me as I ventured across the country to compete in mobile app
    development competitions in which I ended up placing second nationally two
    years in a row and enjoyed local news stardom.

    Since then, while working directly with students and faculty as a K12
    district technology assistant, I've discovered a newfound love for the role
    of technology in education.

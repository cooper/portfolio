        Hi, I'm Mitch.
    }
    
    I'm a freelance web and mobile app developer.
    
    For years I've been privileged to offer computer support and repair services
    to the Greater Lafayette, Indiana area; but more recently my time has been
    allocated primarily to freelance and hobby software development.
    
    I would be thrilled to work with you on your next project, whether it be
    a simple website like this one or a sophisticated million-dollar app idea.
    You'll find on this site an assortment of my current and past works,
    each demonstrating my diverse skillset.

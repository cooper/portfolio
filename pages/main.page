        Hi, I'm Mitch.
    }
    
    I'm an award-winning Las Vegas Valley web and mobile app developer with a
    focus in education.
    
    Technology has been my primary interest for as long as I can remember. It
    started at a young age with the disassembly of clock radios and telephone
    answering machines,
 an

    am self-taught in hands-on computer work and a number of programming
    languages.

    For years I was privileged to offer computer support and repair services to
    my friends and family in Indiana, a hobby which quickly expanded beyond them
    by word of mouth. Before long, my self-taught programming skills landed me
    web design gigs for local organizations.


    In high school, those same friends and family continued to support me as I
    ventured across the country to compete in mobile app development competitions in which I placed second nationally two years in a row.


Since then, while working as a K12 district technology
    assistant, I discovered a love for the role of technology in education.

    

but more recently my time has been
    allocated primarily to freelance and hobby software development.
    
    I would be thrilled to work with you on your next project, whether it be
    a simple website like this one or a sophisticated million-dollar app idea.
    You'll find on this site an assortment of my current and past works,
    each demonstrating my diverse skillset.

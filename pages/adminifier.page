    adminifier is an administrative web panel for wikifier.
    
    The whole point of wikifier is that it is file-based, meaning you can
    edit the content easily from a simple text editor. This was fine at first
    but became tedious once I expanded wikifier to be a full-blown CMS.
    
    Written in PHP, this administrative frontend is an independent project
    which makes it easy to manage a wikifier-based website from the web browser.
    It features a page editor with a large array of visual tools,
    media uploader, revision viewer, site configuration editor, and more.
    
    adminifier does not provide a WYSIWYG editor but instead embraces the
    minimalistic elegance of the wikifier markup language with a variety of
    tools to simplify its writing.

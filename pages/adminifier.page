    adminifier is an administrative web panel for [[quiki]] and [[wikifier]].
    
    Although the "whole point" of quiki is for sites to be simple enough to
    manager in a plain-text editor, adminifier conveniently bridges that beloved
    environment to the web browser. As such, it does not provide a WYSIWYG
    editor but instead embraces the minimalistic elegance of the quiki markup
    language with a variety of tools to simplify its writing.

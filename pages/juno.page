    Yes. It really is an IRC daemon. It's written in Perl.
    
    juno is a seriously modern chat server. It is designed to be ridiculously
    extensible, painlessly reloadable, and excessively configurable.
    
    Perl is one of my favorite languages, and this is my showcase project
    gluing together many of my open source libraries written in it. One of the
    features I am most proud of is the ability to upgrade the entire application
    without dropping any network connections.
    
    I have been developing juno since late 2009, making it the most mature of
    my hobby projects still under active development. It started as a fork of
    pIRCd and was my first project in Perl, but it has since been rewritten from
    the ground up a couple times.

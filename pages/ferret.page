    Ferret is an evented, objective hobby programming language.

    By [i]evented[/i], I mean that all functions are implemented as events,
    each of which can have any number of responders and return values.
    By [i]objective[/i], I mean that all values in Ferret are objects.
    By [i]hobby[/i], I mean that I know it will never be used by any
    project to be taken seriously.
    
    I don't think it's uncommon for a programmer to visualize an idealist
    language with all of their favorite features from each existing one
    glued together and a few original ideas mixed in. But it's
    probably not all that common to take the time to fabricate such a thing.
    Ferret is my actualization of exactly that.
    
    A very-high-level language, both its compiler and runtime
    are written in Perl, but I'm in the process of porting the runtime to Go.
    Eventually the Perl compiler will generate Go interpreter bytecode.

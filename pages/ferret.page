    Ferret is an evented, objective hobby programming language.

    By [i]evented[/i], I mean that all functions are implemented as events,
    each of which can have any number of responders and return values.
    By [i]objective[/i], I mean that all values in Ferret are objects.
    By [i]hobby[/i], I mean that I know it will probably never be used by any
    project to be taken seriously.
    
    I don't think it's uncommon for a programmer to visualization an idealist
    language with all of their favorite features from each existing language
    glued together. But it's probably not that common to take the time to
    fabricate such a thing. Ferret is my actualization of exactly that.
    
    Both the Ferret compiler and runtime are written in Perl currently, but I'm
    in the process of porting the runtime to Go. Eventually the Perl compiler
    will generate bytecode which runs in a Go interpreter.

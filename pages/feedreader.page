    Where you get your news is up to you. But some of us are too indecisive.

    FeedReader conveniently synthesizes breaking news from a diverse
    pool of sources. You can choose from major networks or add custom feeds;
    then organize them all in whatever way makes most sense to you.
    The app features background fetching, article categorization, marking for
    later reading, bulk actions, easy sharing, and more.
    
    I submitted FeedReader's code and presented the app to a
    group of judges for a Mobile Applications competition. I then ventured to
    Anaheim, CA to receive my award of second place at the national level.

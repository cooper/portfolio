    Where you get your news is up to you. But some of us are too indecisive.

    FeedReader synthesizes and conveniently displays breaking news from a diverse
    pool of sources. Users can choose from major networks or add custom feeds.
    The app features background fetching, article categorization, marking for
    later reading, bulk actions, and more. It was my first project written in
    Swift.
    
    I submitted FeedReader's code and presented the app to a
    group of judges for a Mobile Applications competition. I then ventured to
    Anaheim, CA to receive my award of second place at the national level.

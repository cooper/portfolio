    wikifier is a file-based wiki engine written in Perl.
            
    I created it as a basic markup-to-HTML translator, admiring the
    wiki markup concept but finding existing languages such as MediaWiki
    to be unappealing.

    Over the years, wikifier evolved into a full-blown CMS backend that could
    be incorporated into any existing web environment. Although it's been superseded by
    [[ quiki ]], I'm still really proud of the wikifier concept and code base.

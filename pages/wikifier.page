    wikifier is a file-based wiki engine. It is unique in that it
    requires no database and is so simple that it can be managed with nothing
    more than a plain text editor. Yet, it offers page and image caching, image
    sizing, authentication/session management, and lots of other things that
    fancy wikis use databases for.
    
    I created wikifier as a simple markup-to-HTML translator. I admired the wiki
    concept but found existing wiki markup languages such as MediaWiki
    to be unappealing to the eye. Over the years, wikifier has evolved from a
    simple script into a complete modular wiki suite and CMS powering this
    website and many others.

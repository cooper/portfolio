    wikifier is a file-based wiki engine. It is unique in that it
    requires no database and is so simple that it can be managed with nothing
    more than a plain text editor. Yet, wikifier offers image and page caching,
    image sizing, authentication/session management, templates, page categories,
    revision tracking, and lots of other things for which fancy wikis use
    databases.
        
    I created wikifier as a basic markup-to-HTML translator. I admired the wiki
    concept but found existing wiki markup languages such as MediaWiki
    to be unappealing to the eye. The wikifier source language is much easier
    to look at (and in my opinion, to write) than most.
    
    Over the years, wikifier has evolved from a simple script into a complete
    modular wiki suite and CMS powering this website and many others.

    wikifier is a file-based wiki engine and CMS.
    
    It is unique in that it requires no database and can be managed
    with a plain text editor. Yet, it offers image and page caching, image
    sizing, session management, templates, categories, revision tracking, and
    lots of other things.
        
    I created wikifier as a basic markup-to-HTML translator. I admired the wiki
    concept but found existing markup languages such as MediaWiki
    to be unappealing. The wikifier source language is much easier to look at
    (and in my opinion, to write) than most.
    
    Over the years, wikifier has evolved from a simple script into a complete
    modular wiki suite and CMS powering this website and many others.

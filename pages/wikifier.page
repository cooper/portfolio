    wikifier is a file-based wiki engine and CMS.
    
    It is unique in that it requires no database and can be managed
    with a plain text editor. Yet, it offers image and page caching, image
    sizing, session management, templates, categories, revision tracking, and
    lots of other things.
        
    I created wikifier as a basic markup-to-HTML translator. I admired the wiki
    concept but found existing markup languages such as MediaWiki
    to be unappealing. The wikifier source language is much easier to look at
    (and in my opinion, to write) than most.
    
    Over the years, wikifier has evolved from a simple script into a complete
    modular wiki suite and CMS powering
    [[ this website | http://source.mitchellcooper.me ]] and many others.

    [b]L[/b]unch [b]M[/b]enu [b]M[/b]anger is a centralized solution for
    maintaining and distributing cafeteria menus. It is written in PHP and
    stores data with SQLite, making it quite portable and fairly
    simple to incorporate into any facility's existing web services.

    LMM turns a tedious, repetitive multi-step process into one which can be
    completed weeks or months in advance in just one sitting. Input your menu
    just [i]once[/i], and let LMM handle the logistics.
    
    I created this as a school improvement project while I was a technology
    intern at my high school but then decided to open source it. LMM is in
    production at multiple schools now.

    Bored? Take a meander.

    Meander is a fun way to meet new people and make friends. It offers
    hours of entertainment to just about anyone by exploring the world's
    diverse culture and expanding world views through conversation with intriguing
    individuals from all across the globe. Meander has four different chatting
    modes, so you'll never get bored. You can even participate in several
    conversations all at the same time.
    
    After having familiarized myself with macOS app development, Meander was my
    first dive into iOS with a server-side backend and statistics server.

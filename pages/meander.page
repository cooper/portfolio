    Bored? Take a [i]meander[/i].

    Meander is a fun way to meet new people and make new friends. It offers
    hours of entertainment to just about anyone. It gives you the the
    opportunity to [i]meander[/i] through the world's diverse culture and expand
    your world view by conversing with intriguing individuals from all across
    the globe. Meander has four different chatting modes, so you'll never get
    bored. You can even participate in several conversations all at the same
    time.
    
    After having familiarized myself with OS X app development, Meander was my
    first dive into iOS, born in 2012.

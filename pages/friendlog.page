    In sixth grade, I set up a social networking site. I wanted
    to create a community for me and my friends, many of whom did not have
    Facebook because their parents did not allow it. Times have changed!

    I made business cards to hand out to my peers at school. Within mere weeks,
    all the coolest kids at Frontier Elementary used FriendLog as their primary
    means of extramural communication (with parental permission, of course).
    The site expanded to have hundreds of users with loads of uploaded
    content. The custom design was colorful and ever-evolving, each profile with
    a fine-tuned theme.
    
    By late 2010, FriendLog had been overtaken by younger folk and was no longer
    of interest to me. I backed up all of the content on a laptop which later
    was lost. The version pictured was an incomplete recreation written from
    scratch, but it never gained traction. FriendLog exists now only in our
    memory.

    In sixth grade, I set up a social networking site. I wanted
    to create a community for me and my friends, many of whom did not have
    Facebook because their parents did not allow it. Times have changed!
    
    /*
        The entire social networking platform was built into the service, but I
        created custom graphics in GIMP and created custom pages based on free CSS
        templates.
    */
    
    I made business cards and invitations to hand out to my peers at
    school. With mere weeks, all the coolest kids at Frontier Elementary School
    used FriendLog as their primary means of extramural communication
    (with parental permission, of course).
    /*
        Before long, the limitations of the FreeWebs platform were becoming
        apparent, so I experimented with Elgg, Dolphin, and some other social
        networking frameworks before ultimately moving FriendLog over to Ning.
    */
    The site expanded to have hundreds of users with loads of uploaded
    content. The custom site design was colorful and ever-evolving. I made
    custom profile themes for my closest friends, too.
    
    By late 2010, FriendLog had been overtaken by younger folk and was no longer
    of interest to me, so I removed it from production. I backed up all of the
    content on a laptop which later was lost.
    
    The version pictured was an incomplete recreation written from scratch in
    PHP, but it never gained traction. FriendLog exists now only in our memory.

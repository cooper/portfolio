    quiki is a standalone web server for wikifier.
    
    wikifier is a wiki engine, and it alone is not capable of serving
    content directly to users. Instead, web servers must communicate with
    wikifier via some sort of transport, usually utilizing PHP or some other
    intermediate language to do so.
    
    quiki makes it easier to get a site up and running in just minutes,
    eliminating the need for an intermediary. It can be incorporated into any
    existing web environment with a proxy.
    
    quiki powers this website and several others.

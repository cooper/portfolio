    Today's students. Tomorrow's business professionals.
    
    After being elected President of my high school's Business Professionals of
    America chapter, one of my primary goals was to strengthen our online
    presence. I felt this would not only promote interest in our organization
    and its goals; but it would also be a useful tool in attracting potential
    contributors to our primarily donation-supported platform.
    
    The wikifier-based site features a daily activity journal, member
    biographies, competitive event rules and results, a photo gallery, a
    calendar, and more.

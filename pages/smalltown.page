    This template demonstrates a municipal website concept.
    
    The wikifier-based site features a news blog, event calendar, map of
    points of interest, and models for pages common to municipal websites
    such as the offices of elected officials, parks and recreation, and more.
    
    The example here is filled with content about my home community,
    Chalmers, Indiana.

    You thought this was only about coding! No, this page is called "hobbies"
    after all...

    What drew me to the Las Vegas area was not the gambling or nightlife. It is so much
    more than that. Many visit without ever knowing it is among the most sublime natural
    areas in the country. And with sunny days all through the year, I take full advantage of
    every opportunity to hike up mountains, hop rock to rock in canyon creeks,
    and enjoy wildflowers and wildlife. I am drawn to all natural beauty.

    My favorite local spots are Red Rock Canyon, Lake Mead, Mt. Charleston,
    and the Valley of Fire. Very seldom does a week pass that I don't go to at least one.
    Because there are so many amazing national parks within
    drivable distance, I love to venture out of town as well.
    
    I've shared many of my adventures here for all to enjoy.
